#  mrs Branch: moware 
MoWare 2019   - MRS edition
[Compatible with MPS 3.3.5] 

The moware 2019 software stack consists of three domain specific languages (DSL’s) 
to model the different aspects of business applications. The languages are tightly 
integrated. Thus, the languages can be stacked on top of each other, to model a 
whole business application seamlessly, starting with the database access,
the transformation of data via business logic and the visualization in user interfaces.

```
MoWare 2019 is not compatible to earlier releases like the MoWare RC50.
